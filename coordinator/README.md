# Coordinator

Install the coordinator from a machine that can reach the Ubuntu server over
SSH:

```sh
./coordinator/install <server-ssh-host>
```

The SSH destination is supplied at runtime so the server hostname or address
does not enter Git. The installer uses pnpm to build the React client, copies
only the production artifacts and coordinator to `/opt/cortex-home`, installs
`cortex-home.service`, and starts the coordinator on port 8080. Node.js and pnpm
are build-time dependencies only; the server runtime still requires only
Python.

For local development, start the coordinator:

```sh
python3 coordinator/cortex_home.py --host 127.0.0.1
```

Then start the Vite client in another terminal:

```sh
pnpm --dir coordinator/client install
pnpm --dir coordinator/client dev
```

Run the automated checks with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s coordinator/tests
pnpm --dir coordinator/client check
pnpm --dir coordinator/client build
```

With the endpoint connected, an outside caller can invoke the only allowed
action:

```sh
curl \
  --fail-with-body \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"requestId":"manual-1","action":"endpoint.identify"}' \
  http://<server-host>:8080/api/actions
```

The request remains open until the endpoint reports completion or failure. The
JSON response carries the same request ID. Use a new request ID for every
invocation while the coordinator process remains running.
